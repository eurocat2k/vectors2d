![Demo](docs/img/pic.png)

## Description

This small JS application  demonstrates basic vector manipulations - addition, subtraction, scale, dot product, distance, direction and magnitude.

Using mouse pointer user user can dynamically update the following elements:

- vector AB + AM
- vector AB - AM
- vector dot product (AM &bull; AB)
- angle &theta; - angle between AM and AP


> At window load event the mouse pointer drags point **M** along the canvas, however if user clicks on the canvas once fixes the ***M*** at the click position. Another click on the canvas releases the point, and allows to follow the mouse pointer around the canvas.
